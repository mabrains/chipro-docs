Version History helps you track and manage changes in your project over time.
Chipro uses Git under the hood but provides a streamlined UI for creating commits, restoring versions, and tagging releases.

If **Version History** isn't visible, open the **Actions** panel first.

## Change Indicators (Yellow Dots)

A **yellow dot** next to a library, cell, or view indicates that it contains **unsaved changes**.
These items will appear in the commit panel when you create a new commit.
