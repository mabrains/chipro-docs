# Copy or Move Cells

This guide focuses on clipboard actions for cells—how to select them, trigger Copy/Move, validate destinations, and finish a paste.

---

## 1. Enter Selection Mode

Click on select then select one or more cells from the **Cells** panel, then click **Select** to enable selection mode.

Each cell becomes selectable, and a toolbar appears showing available actions:

- **Copy**
- **Move**
- **Delete**

You can capture a single cell or multiple items at once.

## 2. Copy or Move Cells

After selecting, choose either:

- **Copy** – duplicates the selected cells.
- **Move** – relocates the selected cells to a different library or category.

## 3. Open the Paste Dialog

Navigate to the target library or category. A **Paste** button displays only when the destination is valid.

Click **Paste** to open the dialog.

The dialog shows:

- **Source** – original location.
- **Target** – current destination.
- **Items to Paste** – list of cells queued for transfer.
- **Configuration** – extra options when available.

---

## 4. Finish the Paste

Click **Paste Item** (or **Paste X items**) to complete the transfer.

Once the paste completes:

- Cells appear in the new library/category.
- Modified timestamps update.
- Indicators show the change.

The behavior is identical for both copy and move—only the source location changes.
