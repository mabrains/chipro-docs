Assigning cells lets you place unassigned cells into a category.

To assign cells:

1. Open the category options menu (⋯).
2. Click **Assign Cells**.
3. Use the search and list to pick one or more available unassigned cells.
4. Click **Assign Selected**.

### After Assigning Cells

Once you click **Assign Selected**, the chosen cells are immediately added to the selected category.
They will now appear in the **Cells** list when that category is active, making it easier to organize and navigate your design components. Assigned cells are no longer shown in the *unassigned cell list*, helping keep your workspace tidy.

### Select All (visible)

The **Select all (visible)** option lets you instantly highlight every cell currently shown in the list.
This is especially useful when:

* You have many unassigned cells, and the search or filters narrow down the list.
* You want to quickly assign all filtered cells without selecting them one by one.

Only the cells currently displayed are selected — not those outside the visible filtered list.

### Clear

The **Clear** option removes all selections you’ve made in the dialog.
Use this when:

* You selected some cells by mistake,
* Or you want to reset your selection before choosing a new set.

This returns the selection count to zero without closing the dialog.
