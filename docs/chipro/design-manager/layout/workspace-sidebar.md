# Workspace Sidebar

The **Workspace Sidebar** is the vertical dock located on the left side of the **Design Manager**.
It provides quick access to the three primary layout panels, allowing you to customize your workspace for clarity and efficiency:

* **Projects**
* **Libraries**
* **Categories**

Use the sidebar to show or hide these panels depending on your current workflow needs.
