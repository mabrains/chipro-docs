Cells are the core building blocks of every library.  
Each cell represents a design entity — such as an inverter, op-amp, mixer, or layout block — and contains multiple views (schematic, layout, symbol, netlist, …).

The **Cells Panel** shows all cells that belong to the currently selected library and category.
