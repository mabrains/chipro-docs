Selecting a cell opens the **Cell Details** panel on the right.  
This panel gives you a quick overview of the cell and access to its views.

## Cell Information

The details panel shows the essential information for the selected cell:

- **Name**  
- **Description**  
- **Created Date**  
- **Last Modified Date**

This makes it easy to confirm you’re working with the correct cell before opening or editing anything.

## Views

The **Views** section lists all available design views (schematic, layout, symbol, netlist, …).

If the cell doesn’t have any views yet, you’ll see a placeholder with a button to create the first view.
