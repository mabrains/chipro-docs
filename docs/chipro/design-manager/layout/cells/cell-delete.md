## Before You Delete

Deleting a cell removes:

- All views (schematic, layout, symbol, netlist, …)
- All stored files and artifacts
- All metadata
- All references across your project and libraries

If you may need the cell later, you can:

- **Commit it using Versioning**, or
- Copy it to another library

before deleting.
