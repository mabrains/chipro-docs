Projects form the **top level of Design Manager’s hierarchy** — the anchor that connects libraries, cells, categories, and automation history together.  
Every workflow begins by **creating or selecting a project**, since all design data (libraries, runs, commits) is scoped to that active context.

## Projects Sidebar

The leftmost sidebar lists all your projects, **grouped by PDK**.  
This makes it easy to distinguish between technologies like `GF180`, `IHP-SG13`, or `SKY130`.  
Each project card displays:

- The project’s name and technology node
- The number of libraries within it
- A subtle highlight when selected

You can search projects instantly.
