## Overview

Libraries represent the **second level of Design Manager’s hierarchy**.  
Each project contains one or more libraries, and each library contains the cells that form your schematics, layouts, and reusable design blocks.

Libraries help you:

- Organize cells by function (digital, analog, RF…)
- Group related components under the same hierarchy
- Manage metadata, versioning, and settings independently per library

## Libraries Panel

When you select a project, the Libraries panel shows:

- A list of libraries for the active project
- A search bar
- A **Create Library** button
- Context menus for Update, View, and Delete actions
