Views represent different design representations of a cell — such as schematic, symbol, layout, netlist, HDL, or simulation outputs.

Each view is stored separately and can be opened in its corresponding external tool (Xschem, KLayout, VSCode-based environment, or LibreLane).

Views let you:

- Draw schematics  
- Create symbols  
- Design layouts  
- Generate netlists  
- Write Verilog  
- Run LibreLane workflows  

You can create, edit, rename, move, copy, or delete views for any cell.
