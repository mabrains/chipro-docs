# Settings Hub Overview

Mohet includes a persistent **Settings** button that opens a multi-tab modal covering everything from embeddings to key rotation. Behind the scenes, the app listens to a global websocket so system-wide notifications reach every route.

- [Update API Key](./update-api-key.md) shows how to rotate credentials without leaving the chat.
- [Embedding Settings](./embedding-settings.md) mirrors the embeddings tab for choosing providers and managing health.
- [Local Model Install](./local-model-install.md) documents the HuggingFace installation form and progress tracking.

Helpful links to provider documentation and support make it easy to recover from outages without leaving the modal.
