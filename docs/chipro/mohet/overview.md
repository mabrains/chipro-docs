# Mohet Assistant

Mohet is Chipro’s integrated AI assistant.  
It can analyze circuits, debug simulation logs, summarize documents, explain Verilog, solve math, and provide end-to-end guidance across your design workflow.

Mohet is built around:

- Provider-based model selection  
- Optional local or cloud embeddings  
- Smart flows designed for analog and digital design  
- Full conversation management  
- Live streaming outputs  
- Tool-call support  

This section documents how Mohet works, how to set it up, and how to get the most out of the assistant.

## What You Can Do With Mohet

- Ask technical questions about analog or digital circuits  
- Debug SPICE or Librelane errors  
- Generate Verilog, SPICE, testbenches  
- Walk through math or timing calculations

## Structure of This Documentation

Use the sections in this category to learn:

- **Getting Started** — provider setup, embedding configuration, first chat  
- **Chat Interface** — layout, composer, streaming, attachments  
- **Providers** — setting API keys, validation, switching models  
- **Embeddings** — why embeddings matter, how to enable them  
- **Conversation Management** — history, search, archive, restore  
- **Settings** — model install, embedding selection, key updates  
- **Real-Time Engine** — WebSocket behaviors, streaming, error states  

Mohet is deeply integrated into Chipro.  
As you build schematic or layout work, you can bring Mohet into the loop to accelerate your design process.
