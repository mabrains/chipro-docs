# Conversation List & Navigation

The conversation sidebar keeps history in view while leaving enough space for the active chat.

## Responsive Sidebar

- **Desktop** – Collapses into icon mode or expands to show full conversation titles. Quick actions for *New Chat*, *Archive*, *Settings*, and *Profile* sit at the top.
- **Mobile** – Opening the sidebar triggers a full-screen overlay with swipe-to-close gestures for safe use on touch devices.

## Grouping & Scrolling

- Threads are grouped by day to make long histories easier to skim.
- Infinite scroll loads older conversations as you reach the end of the list.
- Flow badges and timestamps sit beside each title so teams can triage quickly.

## Inline Controls

- Hover states reveal rename/archive/delete popovers directly in the list.
- The archive button opens a modal with search + restore controls without leaving the page.

Pair the sidebar with the [Create a New Conversation](./create-new-conversation.md) guide to understand how quick actions plug into this layout.
