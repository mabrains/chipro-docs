# Conversations Overview

Mohet treats conversations as first-class data so renaming, archiving, or deleting threads stays in sync across clients.

- [List & Navigation](./list-and-navigation.md) describes how the sidebar behaves on desktop and mobile, plus how infinite scroll groups threads by day.
- [Rename, Archive & Delete](./rename-archive-delete.md) covers metadata editing, archive drawers, and confirmation paths.
- [Create a New Conversation](./create-new-conversation.md) walks through welcome states, quick actions, and how new chats inherit the currently selected flow.

Use these docs to keep the conversation lifecycle consistent even as you add new flows or routing rules.
