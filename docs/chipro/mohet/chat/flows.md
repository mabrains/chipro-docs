# Flows

Flows guide Mohet’s behavior based on the type of task you’re working on.  
Each flow adjusts the assistant’s prompting style and internal reasoning.

## How to Select a Flow

Flows can be chosen:

- From the welcome screen
- From the icon in the chat header
- From the flow popover

If you change the flow inside an active conversation, Mohet displays a reminder that switching flows mid-thread may change context.  
You are encouraged to start a new chat when switching flows for best results.

## Flow Persistence

The selected flow applies only to the current conversation.  
New conversations begin with the last-used flow unless changed manually.
