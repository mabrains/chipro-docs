# Message Actions

Messages in Mohet provide multiple controls so you can refine conversations efficiently.

## User Message Actions

### Copy

Quickly copy your prompt to reuse it elsewhere.

### Edit

Modify any previous user message.  
After editing, Mohet generates a new response based on the updated prompt.

### Delete

Remove unwanted messages from the chat.

---

## Assistant Message Actions

### Copy

Copy the full assistant response to your clipboard.

### Regenerate

Ask Mohet to produce an alternative version of the answer.

### Expand Thought Process

Mohet includes a collapsed section that reveals:

- Reasoning traces
- Tool-call instructions
- System-level metadata

This is optional and useful for deeper analysis or debugging.
