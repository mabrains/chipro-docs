# Getting Started with Mohet

Mohet becomes available as soon as you configure an API provider and optionally enable embeddings.  
This short guide walks you through the first steps so you can start using Mohet confidently.

---

## What You Need Before You Start

Mohet requires three elements:

- A **validated API provider key** (OpenAI, Groq, Mabrains, or custom endpoint)  
- A **selected model** for the provider  
- Optional but recommended **embedding provider** to improve context handling  

If you open Mohet for the first time without a valid setup, Chipro will automatically guide you through the setup wizard.

## Setup Steps

You will be guided through:

1. Choosing a **provider**  
2. Entering and validating your **API key**  
3. Optionally enabling **embeddings**  
4. Choosing a **model** for the assistant  
5. Starting your first conversation

Continue with the pages in this section to configure each part:

- [Provider Setup](./provider-setup.md)  
- [Embedding Setup](./embedding-setup.md)  
- [Model Selection](./model-selection.md)

Once these steps are complete, Mohet is ready.  
You will be taken to the chat interface where you can begin your first conversation.
