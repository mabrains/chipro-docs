# Model Selection

Mohet supports multiple AI models per provider.  
Once your provider key is validated, you can freely choose which model should handle your prompts.

Model choice affects **response quality**, **speed**, and **reasoning depth**.  
The selected model applies to the current conversation unless changed.
