# Embeddings Overview

Embeddings unlock retrieval-augmented generation, smarter tool routing, and context-aware flows. Mohet treats them as a first-class dependency.

- [Why Embeddings](./why-embeddings.md) explains the warning banners and UX nudges that appear when no embedding provider is active.
- [Install a Local Model](./install-local-model.md) covers the onboarding modal for HuggingFace downloads and disk monitoring.
- [Choose an Embedding Provider](./choose-embedding-provider.md) maps out the settings and API-key requirements for keeping embeddings healthy.

Mix and match managed providers with local models to meet security, cost, or latency goals without changing the chat experience.
