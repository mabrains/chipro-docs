# Why Embeddings Matter

Mohet highlights embedding status everywhere because retrieval quality depends on it. When no embedding provider is active, a warning badge appears in the chat header and settings sidebar explaining why responses may degrade.

## Warnings & Education

- The badge links to a popover that explains why embeddings matter and lists the benefits of enabling them.
- Quick links jump to API Key Management so users can add or repair an embedding-capable provider.
- The same content appears in setup, chat, and settings so the message stays consistent.

## User Outcomes

- With embeddings disabled, Mohet reminds users that document summaries, design lookups, and some flows may be limited.
- Once embeddings validate, badges disappear and the UI celebrates the improvement with success toasts.

Use this education layer whenever retrieval-backed features are required so teams never wonder why answers look generic.
