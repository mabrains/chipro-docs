# Launch tools directly from Chipro

1. Select a cell and choose the view (schematic, layout, symbol, etc.) you want to work with.
2. Click **Open in Tool**; Chipro automatically passes the PDK, library, and cell context to the selected tool.
3. When you save inside the tool, Chipro syncs the updated files back into Design Manager in near real time.

If a tool button is missing, verify that the required view exists.
