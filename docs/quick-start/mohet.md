# Collaborate with Mohet Chat

1. Open the **Mohet Chat** panel from the right-side drawer or via the chatbot icon.
2. Ask Mohet to summarize the active cell, explain a waveform, or draft a SPICE/Verilog snippet.
3. Reference specific cells or runs in your prompt so Mohet can ground the response in the correct context.
4. Use the follow-up actions to insert generated content back into your design or attach it to comments.

See the [full Mohet guide](../chipro/mohet/overview.md) for advanced prompt styles and automation triggers.
