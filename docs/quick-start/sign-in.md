Follow the steps below.

## 1. Sign in to Mabrains

Open the Mabrains platform in your browser and Use the top-right menu to access your account options.

Fill out the form:

- **Description** — optional note about how this key will be used  
- **Expiry Date** — defaults to one year, but you may choose any future date

When you are ready, click **Create Key**.

## 4. Copy and Save Your API Key

Once generated, the platform shows your new API key only once.

- Secure environment variable storage  
- A private secrets vault  

You will not be able to view this key again.

Click **I’ve Saved It** once done.

## 5. View Your Active Key

Your key will now appear in the API Keys list with its metadata:
