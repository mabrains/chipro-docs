# Chipro Quick Start Overview

This Quick Start sequence is the fastest path from a blank workspace to a collaborative Chipro environment with live tooling, AI copilots, and versioned design data. Think of this page as your checklist—each bullet links to a deeper guide that walks through the clicks, screenshots, and validation states.

## Phase 1 – Access & Platform Setup

1. **[Sign in & create an API key](./sign-in.md)** – authenticate your browser session and generate the token that powers integrations and automation.
2. **[Install Chipro](./installation.md)** – set up the core platform binaries, CLI, and services on your workstation or server.

## Phase 2 – Enable Design Context

3. **[Install or link a PDK](./pdk.md)** – register the process design kit so schematic/layout tools, job flows, and validations know which technology to target.
4. **[Create a project](./create-project.md)** – spin up a Design Manager project tied to that PDK with the right metadata, access, and shortcuts.
5. **[Add libraries, categories, and cells](./libraries-cells.md)** – organize your hierarchy before opening tools to keep IP reuse and automation filters tidy.

## Phase 3 – Build & Collaborate

6. **[Launch tools directly from Chipro](./tools.md)** – open xschem, KLayout, or ngspice via “Open in Tool” buttons without reconfiguring PDK paths.
7. **[Collaborate with Mohet Chat](./mohet.md)** – bring the AI copilot into the flow for Q&A, code scaffolding, log summaries, and design reviews.
8. **[Version & automate](./versioning-automation.md)** – commit your state, tag milestones, and trigger Librelane/EDA jobs from the Actions panel.
