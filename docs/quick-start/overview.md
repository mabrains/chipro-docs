# Chipro Quick Start Overview

Get productive in Chipro in minutes by following this sequence:

1. [Sign in & create an API key](./sign-in.md) so Chipro can authenticate your browser and automations.
2. [Install a PDK](../chipro/design-manager/pdks/install.md) to make tool launchers and flows available.
3. [Create a project in Design Manager](../chipro/design-manager/layout/projects/create-project.md) that targets the installed PDK.
4. [Add libraries, categories, and cells](./libraries-cells.md) to organize design data.
5. [Launch tools directly from Chipro](./tools.md) using “Open in Tool” buttons.
6. [Collaborate with Mohet Chat](./mohet.md) to reason about designs with AI context.
7. [Version and automate your work](../chipro/design-manager/versioning/overview.md) via commits and job triggers.

Each linked guide focuses on a single task so you can iterate step-by-step.
